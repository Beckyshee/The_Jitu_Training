<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
   <p>During my time as a student i have had the opportunity to interact with some programming languages that have helped <br> me in different areas of my journey.
I was able to utilise some of the languages while doing my capstone project and <br>
the skills that i learnt not only programming skill, but also communication skills came in handy.</p> 
   
   <h3>ACHIVEMENTS</h3>
   <P>
    My journey so far has been fun and exciting. I have worked on some simple yet fun projects here and there. I have been <br> able to collaborate with friends on some of the projects and gained insight on the upside and downside of working as a team. <br>
